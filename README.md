# Advent of Code 2022 - Solutions in Scala

Solving the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) puzzles is very rewarding.

My incentive to solving them, is to make the most readable, concise and type safe solution I can think of, and along the way showcasing Scala as a programming language that hits the sweet spot on power and reasonability. I will be very curious to solutions in other programming languages (or again in Scala) that you believe to be at least as readable, so please share!
